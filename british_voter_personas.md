## Usage Instructions for Policy Testing

### How to Use These Personas:

1. **Select Relevant Personas**: Choose 3-5 personas that represent key voter segments for your policy area
2. **Present the Policy**: Describe the policy proposal in neutral terms
3. **Gather Responses**: Ask each persona to respond with their likely reaction, concerns, and voting implications
4. **Analyze Patterns**: Look for common themes, unexpected reactions, and coalition-building opportunities

### Sample Testing Framework:

For each persona, ask:
- "What is your immediate reaction to this policy proposal?"
- "What concerns or benefits do you see for people like you?"
- "How might this influence your voting intention?"
- "What would need to change about this policy to make it more appealing?"

### Key Considerations:

- **Geographic Variation**: These personas represent different regions with varying political contexts
- **Cross-Cutting Issues**: Some policies will unite unlikely coalitions, others will divide traditional allies
- **Intensity Matters**: Note not just support/opposition but how strongly each persona feels
- **Implementation Details**: Often the 'how' matters more than the 'what' for voter reactions

This framework allows for systematic testing of how different voter segments might respond to policy proposals across the key divides in British politics: class, age, geography, education, and cultural values.
